# Archetypal Wavelength

The Archetypal Wavelength is a integral framework explaining cyclical patters, especially your pendulums of mood, emotion and development.

## Phases

Each cycles moves through 6 phases, representing a sine curve cut into six segments: Rising, Peaking, Withdrawal, Diminishing, Bottoming Out, and Restoration, after which comes Rising once again.

## Frequencies

Each color represents a Frequency through which the Wavelength can express. Note: Higher is not better. Specific colors chosen don't signify anything. 

- **Beige** (Agency): Inhabit, Do 
- **Purple** (Receptivity): Inhabit, Feel
- **Red** (Self-Love): Express, Do
- **Blue** (Community Love): Express, Feel
- **Orange** (Intellectual Understanding): Collaborate, Do
- **Green** (Embodied Understanding): Collaborate, Feel
- **Yellow** (Systems Wisdom): Integrate, Do
- **Teal** (Higher Self Wisdom): Integrate, Feel
- **Ultraviolet** (Union): Absorb, Both Do/Feel
- **Clear Light** (Emptiness): Be, Neither/All 

## Dosages

*"The difference between medicine and poison is dosage."*

Each feeling exists in two forms:

- **Medicinal**: The healthy expression
- **Toxic**: The excessive or shadow form

Often simply recognizing that you are in a Toxic state and aiming to embody the Medicinal is enough to regulate or alchemize a painful mood!

## Self-Care Strategies

Each phase has specific strategies to help you reduce your activation level from Toxic overdoses toward the balance and temperance of the Medicinal.
