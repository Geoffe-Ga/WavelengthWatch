# Archetypal Wavelength

The Archetypal Wavelength is a framework for understanding emotional and developmental patterns.

## Layers

Each color represents a developmental stage, from Beige (survival) through Purple (tribal), Red (power), and beyond.

## Phases

Each layer cycles through phases: Rising, Peaking, Falling, Recovering, Integrating, and Embodying.

## Dosages

Each feeling exists in two forms:

- **Medicinal**: The healthy expression
- **Toxic**: The shadow or excessive form

## Self-Care Strategies

Each phase has specific strategies to help you navigate that emotional territory with grace.
