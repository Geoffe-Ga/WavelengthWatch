# Contributing to WavelengthWatch

Thanks for helping evolve WavelengthWatch! This guide summarizes the expectations that keep the project healthy and describes the current journal architecture so you can propose changes with shared context.

## Workflow Expectations

- **TDD first**: Write a failing test before shipping a feature or bug fix. Backend tests live under `tests/backend/`. Watch tests reside in the Xcode test targets.
- **Green CI**: Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pytest`, and the relevant Xcode tests locally before pushing. Every pull request must ship with passing GitHub Actions checks.
- **Small, atomic commits**: Group related changes together. Include a short summary of what changed and why.
- **Documentation parity**: Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or other docs when you alter the system. Place any coordination or planning notes in `prompts/claude-comm/` so future contributors inherit the full story.

## Journal System Reference

Understanding the shipping journal flow prevents redundant rewrites:

- **Data model**: `backend/models.py` exposes a `Journal` SQLModel table referencing `Curriculum` and optional `Strategy` rows. The `InitiatedBy` enum differentiates self-started entries from scheduled ones.
- **Schemas & validation**: `backend/schemas.py` validates timestamps (UTC-normalized) and defers foreign-key checks to `backend/routers/journal.py`, which re-queries with `joinedload` so responses come back hydrated.
- **Watch client**: `JournalClient` (Swift) derives a pseudo-user ID from `UserDefaults`, stamps `createdAt`, and posts to `/api/v1/journal`. UI alerts trigger submissions and present success/failure feedback immediately.
- **Strengths**: Simple schema, reusable joins with existing catalog data, and production-friendly HTTP contracts.
- **Trade-offs**: No queued retries or batch submission yet; expanding to multi-combo journaling will require additional schema changes and eventual migrations.

Bring proposals that build on these merits or explicitly outline how you plan to mitigate the known trade-offs.

## Pull Request Checklist

1. `pre-commit run --all-files`
2. `pytest tests/backend -q`
3. Run targeted Xcode tests (or provide an explanation and follow-up plan)
4. Update documentation and changelog entries as needed
5. Confirm communication artifacts live under `prompts/claude-comm/`

We appreciate thorough write-ups in your PR descriptionâ€”call out assumptions, data migrations (if any), and manual test steps performed. Happy building!
